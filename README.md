# Create Branches and Merging
in this tutorial we're going to learn about how to create branches from the main branch in the remote repository and 
how we can merge those changes with the branches to the main branch in the remote repositor.The main reason why we need
to create branches lout of the main/master branch is that not mess things up with main/master branches,when there are
changes or refactoring we want with our code,because the main/master branch is a branch ready for production.
